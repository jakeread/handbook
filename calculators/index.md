## Sims and Calculators 

- stepper motor simulator 
- transmission ratios, etc 
- mass vs. accelerations... 
- belts-as-springs ? deflection / mm 
	- stiffness: of transmissions, of bearing blocks, 
		- i.e. if we have four carriages 
- impedance matching 
	- rotor inertia to linear inertia (i.e. ballscrew and slide) 
	- if you match inertias, you maximize power transfer 
	- for max accel, minimize total mass *and* match inertias 
- chip load calculators 
- fdm flow rate 

## Spreadsheet Templating ?

- can we write calculators that download as spreadsheets, with cells filled in as a starting point ?
