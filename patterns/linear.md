## Linear Guideway Patterns 

- "ways" (flat surfaces... oil film (normally)) 
- air bearings ? 
- plain bushings (on centerless ground)
- recirculating ball bushings (on centerless ground) 
- recirculating ball linear guideways (i.e. MGN12x)
- v-rollers, gothic-arch rollers
  - "roller coaster wheel" 
    - flat bearing on ... surface 
	- typical parts from each implementations ("the cannon, the commons")
	- https://www.pbclinear.com/Products/Cam-Roller-Technology/Redi-Rail-Linear-Guide lots of good precedent
    - also looks like `SG15` UXCELL bearings are ideal-ish, these are close to it
    - check i.e. https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832250975713.html
    - these are "gothic arch" contact, double-row, really... the clear answer
    - SG15: 6mm rail, 5x17x8 "8kg"
    - SG20: 8mm rail, 6x24x11 "25kg"
    - LFR50 (?)

## Linear, Serial Transmission Patterns 

- leadscrews
	- the leadscrew turns 
	- the ball-nut turns 
- belts
	- belt-and-pinion 
	- idler-and-pulley (belt loop, traditional, ...)
  - harmonic belt / windlass 
- rack and pinion 
  - "cycloidal pinions" 
- capstan 
	- winch capstan 
- linear motor:
  - three-phase and stepper-type 
  - (an aside?) ASML's levitating drives 

## Linear, Parallel Patterns 

- corexy 
- h-bot
- "evil mad scientist" ... "axidraw" 
- "ultimaker style"
