## Linear Guideway Patterns 

- "ways" (flat surfaces... oil film (normally)) 
- air bearings ? 
- plain bushings (on centerless ground)
- recirculating ball bushings (on centerless ground) 
- recirculating ball linear guideways (i.e. MGN12x)
- v-rollers, gothic-arch rollers, linear carriages, linear-shaft-ball-bearings
	- typical parts from each implementations ("the cannon, the commons")

## Linear, Serial Transmission Patterns 

- leadscrews
	- the leadscrew turns 
	- the ball-nut turns 
- belts
	- belt-and-pinion 
	- idler-and-pulley (belt loop, traditional, ...)
  - we want a belt stiffness calculator, with i.e. presets for standard-ish components (GT2 of different widths)
- rack and pinion 
- capstan 
	- winch capstan 
- can we get a steps-per-millimeter calculator 

## Linear, Parallel Patterns 

- corexy 
- h-bot
- "evil mad scientist" ... "axidraw" 
- "ultimaker style"
