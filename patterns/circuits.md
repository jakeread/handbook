## Circuit Design Patterns 

- current limiting resitor
	- LEDs
	- ... not-microcontroller-frying 
- pullups / pulldowns 
	- switches (buttons) 
	- I2C 
	- open drain 
- voltage dividers 
- rc filters 
- high pass (capacitance) filters 
- bypass capacitors 
- busses / comms 
	- SPI, I2C, UART, LVDS, CAN ... 
- bridges (half, full) 
	- ... power electronics patterns, yikes 
- adcs, dacs, 
- connectors...
	- enumeration, what are common, trade-offs, 
	- junction resistance (and calculator)
