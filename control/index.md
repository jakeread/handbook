## Controller Patterns 

- junction deviation 
- "dynamic prog" lookahead 
- closed-loop (FOC) control of a stepper motor
- chopper drivers, "stall guard" 
- (a spreadsheet) accelerations, torques, and masses 

## Systems Patterns 

- bus topologies
	- rings, single-medium, duplexes 
- demux RS485 from UART 
- COBS, packet delineation 
- flow-control,
