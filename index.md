# Machinery's Design Handbook 

> the book is a tool  
> patterns, circuits, control, reading, theory 

#### Possible Titles 

```
- Machine Design for Makers 
- Design Patterns from the Field 
- Machine Design Handbook 
- Machinery Invention Handbook
- Machinery Building Handbook
- The Art of Machine Design (maybe ?) 
- The Practice of Machine Design 
- "Cookbook" or "Recipes" 
```

--- 

### What it Could Contain

Design patterns, reference material, and enumerations (and elucidations) of various practical approaches to real-world machine building tasks. 

### Other Nuggets

- references go online now, everything else should be not-online
  - jake: how to do ? 
- do we need a disclaimer ? 
- ashy chart for actuators 
- (jake) find datasheet of stiffnesses for miniature guide blocks 
- circuits is its own section 

### Site Meta

- instead of comments or discussion... folks could be reminded (in footer?) that the site source is on github, and they can make an issue or a PR to improve / change things 
- ... train an LLM to think and sketch about machines, and put a chatbot in this site ? 

### Rote TODOs

- pull (and improve?) content from [mechanisms class](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/topics/mechanical_design/index.html) and [power electronics class](https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/865.21/topics/power_electronics/index.html) 
- also pull i.e. [this thing](https://ekswhyzee.com/2019/04/09/gt2-belt-rotary-cad.html) 

### Organization 

I've taken a quick pass; I think that individual pages / nuggets are straightforwards but then the top-level organization is not... design is not hierarchichal, so ideally we could hook everything up unilaterally. Perhaps there is a CMS for that.
